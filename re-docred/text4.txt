Title: Bantustan
Content: A Bantustan ( also known as Bantu homeland,black homeland,black state or simply homeland ; ) was a territory set aside for black inhabitants of South Africa and South West Africa ( now Namibia ),as part of the policy of apartheid.Ten Bantustans were established in South Africa,and then in neighbouring South West Africa ( then under South African administration ),for the purpose of concentrating the members of designated ethnic groups,thus making each of those territories ethnically homogeneous as the basis for creating " autonomous " nation states for South Africa 's different black ethnic groups.The term was first used in the late 1940s and was coined from Bantu ( meaning " people " in some of the Bantu languages ) and -stan ( a suffix meaning " land " in the Persian language and some Persian - influenced languages of western,central,and southern Asia ).It was regarded as a disparaging term by some critics of the apartheid - era government 's " homelands " ( from Afrikaans tuisland ).The word " bantustan ",today,is often used in a pejorative sense when describing a region that lacks any real legitimacy,consists of several unconnected enclaves,or emerges from national or international gerrymandering.Four of the South African Bantustans — Transkei,Bophuthatswana,Venda,and Ciskei ( the so - called " TBVC States")—were declared independent,but this was not recognised outside South Africa.Other South African Bantustans ( like KwaZulu,Lebowa,and QwaQwa ) received partial autonomy but were never granted independence.In South West Africa,Ovamboland,Kavangoland,and East Caprivi were granted self - determination.The Bantustans were abolished with the end of apartheid and re - joined South Africa proper in 1994.
