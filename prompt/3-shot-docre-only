But you could find out , just from little insights , that a lot of his private thoughts were in there , although a lot of the more meaningful stuff was not very accessible . [1] Lily of the Valley [1] was utterly heartfelt . It 's about looking at his girlfriend and realising that his body needed to be somewhere else . It 's a great piece of art , but it 's the last song that would ever be a hit .
