" In a 1999 interview , 16 told the British music magazine Mojo , " Freddie 's stuff was so heavily cloaked , lyrically ... But you could find out , just from little insights , that a lot of his private thoughts were in there , although a lot of the more meaningful stuff was not very accessible . Lily of the Valley was utterly heartfelt . It 's about looking at his girlfriend and realising that his body needed to be somewhere else . It 's a great piece of art , but it 's the last song that would ever be a hit . " Actor Rami Malek ( who is portraying Freddie Mercury in the upcoming Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody ) revealed on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that " Lily of the Valley " is his favorite Queen song .
